- support -m and -s as flags in config tables??
- add --skip -> skip command if user runes 'koi -j run' or 'koi'
- support clean(up) as section in tables after commands -> counterpart of dependencies 
- rename dependencies to setup, commands to cmd

- support advanced configs e.g. variables, loops etc.

- use shlex for parsing and building bash commands?
- reorder semantically jobs passed to Runner()
