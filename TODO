- fix logs
    --flow -> if there are duplicates in config -> only shown with --allow-duplicates flag
    --finally -> deferred_tasks are put in the common 'successful tasks' list -> separate them?
- support flags inside config tables in .toml -> -m, -s
- run optional pre- and post-cmds (deps & cleanup) only if task run alone, but skip inside a pipeline?
- support mechanism similar to makefile rules/pre-requisites e.g.
    '''foo: bar
          echo 'Hi!'''
    -> opposite of --fail-fast -> pre-requisite tasks should never fail before running current one
- add type hints for shell_manager (contextmanager)

- currently you cannot use '-t run', but you describe 'run' table with -d as if it's a task??
    -> use separate flag for showing run table -> and error if used with -d
==================================
add to README
- describe passing path (or default behavior if missing)
- behavior if run table is missing in config
