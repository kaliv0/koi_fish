- -a and -d cannot be combined
- handle koi -j run -> currently runs all jobs in config -> rename not to colide with 'run' table
- support -v and -s as flags in config tables??
- add --skip -> skip command if user runes 'koi -j run' or 'koi'

- use shlex for parsing and building bash commands
    -> use loops instead of ' && '.join(cmds)

NB: after adding more jobs -> refactor how they are passed to Runner().run
- update readme
