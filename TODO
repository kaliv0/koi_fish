- fix logs
    --flow -> if there are duplicates in config -> only shown with --allow-duplicates flag
    --finally -> deferred_tasks are put in the common 'successful tasks' list -> separate them?

- support flags inside config tables in .toml
    -> -m, -s

- run optional pre- and post-cmds (deps & cleanup) only if task run alone, but skip inside a pipeline?

- support mechanism similar to makefile rules/pre-requisites e.g.
    '''foo: bar
          echo 'Hi!'''
    -> opposite of --fail-fast -> pre-requisite tasks should never fail before running current one

- currently you cannot use '-t run', but you describe 'run' table with -d as if it's a task??

- add tests -> use simple shell commands (echo, false, > /dev/full)

- add type hints for shell_manager (contextmanager)
==================================
add to README
- flags: --fail-fast, --finally, --allow-duplicates, -t (describe flow), -r (run flow)
    -> renamed flags
- renamed config table entries -> short/long
    -> pre, cmd, post, main, info
