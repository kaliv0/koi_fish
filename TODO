- add -a/--all-jobs -> show all jobs from koi.toml with description and commands in command line
- add -s/--show [JOB] -> similar to --all-jobs for selected job

- add -c/--commands -> show commands when running them e.g. uv run ruff format
    -> or show by default without flag

- support -c and -s as flags in config tables??

- add --skip -> skip command if user runes 'koi -j run' or 'koi'

- use shlex for parsing and building bash commands
    -> use loops instead of ' && '.join(cmds)

NB: after adding more jobs -> refactor how they are passed to Runner().run
