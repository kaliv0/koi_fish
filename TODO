- support -c and -s as flags in config tables??
- add --skip -> skip command if user runes 'koi -j run' or 'koi'
- support clean(up) as section in tables after commnds -> counterpart of dependencies 
  (rename dependencies to setup, commands -> cmds?)

- use shlex for parsing and building bash commands?

NB: after adding more jobs -> refactor how they are passed to Runner().run -> incl reorder them semantically
- update readme
