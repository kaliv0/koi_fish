- fix logs
    --suite -> if there are duplicates in config -> only shown with --allow-duplicates flag
    --finally -> deferred_jobs are put in the common 'successful jobs' list -> separate them?

- support flags inside config tables in .toml
    -> -m, -s

- fail-fast mechanism -> currently 'finally' runs jobs from jobs_to_defer if not already in succeeded or failed states

- run optional pre- and post-cmds (deps & cleanup) only if job run alone, but skip inside a pipeline?

- support mechanism similar to makefile rules/pre-requisites e.g.
    '''foo: bar
          echo 'Hi!'''
    -> opposite of --fail-fast -> pre-requisite tasks should never fail before running current one

- fix naming -> jobs_to_defer vs property deferred_jobs

- reorder semantically jobs passed to Runner()

- rename jobs to tasks? / suite to flow/pipeline?
- add missing types to args.parameters

- add tests -> use simple shell commands (echo, false, > /dev/full)

- add type hints for shell_manager (contextmanager)
==================================
add to README
- flags: --fail-fast, --finally, --allow-duplicates, -t (describe suite), -r (run suite)
    -> renamed flags
- renamed config table entries -> short/long
    -> pre, cmd, post, main, info
