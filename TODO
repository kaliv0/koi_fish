- fix logs in scenario:
    run 'koi --skip foo -j foo bar'
    if bar fails -> displays 'Failed jobs: [bar]; Skipped jobs: [foo]'
    else -> displays 'All jobs succeeded! [bar]'
    -> don't show foo in skipped -> or show skipped in both cases?

- support flags inside config tables in .toml
    -> -m, -s

- add multiple flows/pipelines in suite table
    -> run by name in shell
    -> support in -d, -t flags
    -> keep 'main' as default one? -> rename -t/--suite flag

- add fail-fast mechanism -> currently 'finally' runs jobs from jobs_to_defer if not already in succeeded or failed states
- all cli_jobs and deferred_jobs are sets
    -> you cannot schedule twice e.g. teardown even if divided by other jobs in between
    -> add flag to disable duplicate jobs?

- run optional pre- and post-cmds (deps & cleanup) only if job run alone, but skip inside a pipeline?

- support mechanism similar to makefile rules/pre-requisites e.g.
    '''foo: bar
        echo 'Hi!'''
    -> opposite of --fail-fast -> pre-requisite tasks should never fail before running current one

- use Logger instead of print in spinner()
- fix naming -> jobs_to_defer vs property deferred_jobs

- reorder semantically jobs passed to Runner()
- support advanced configs e.g. variables, loops etc.
- use shlex for parsing and building bash commands?

- clear-up commented lines from constants.py
- make animations in color
